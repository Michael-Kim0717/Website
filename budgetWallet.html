              <h5> Home Screen : </h5>
              <br>
              Once the user enters the application, he/she is greeted with a screen that
              they would use to manually enter in their transactions.
              <br> <br>
              The 'Value' label shows the total amount of money for the user's accounts.
              If a specific category is selected, the amount of money of that specific
              account is shown instead.
              <br> <br>
              The 'Category' selector allows the user to pick which account they would like to view and tinker with.
              <br> <br>
              The 'Amount Used / Deposited' field would be the area that the user would enter in their transaction information.
              For example, if you were to get paid $10 in tips for the day, you would enter in 10, press the '+' button, and the $10 would be added into your account.
              <br> <br>
              Lastly the 'How Money Was Used / Deposited' field is where the user would enter how the money was used or received.
              For example, if you received your tips from working at Olive Garden for the day, you would enter "Olive Garden Tips" (or whatever you want).

              This is the screen where the user's journey begins.
              He/she can't necessarily see the values of their accounts until they enter in an account.
              Otherwise, this is the screen they would go to if they wanted to see all the values of their accounts individually or if they want to add another account.
              <br> <br>
              By pressing 'Add Category', the user is given the option to enter in a name for their account as well as a previously existing balance.
              If you know the exact amount of money you have in your Starbuck's gift card, enter in that information and it will display for you.
              <br> <br>
              Lastly, the user the option to delete an account. In the case that you accidently press the DELETE button, an alert will appear if they have existing transactions in the account.

              <br> <br>
              If you want to specifically view all the transactions you've done using your McDonald's gift card,
              you could always select that account in the 'Category Selection' up top.

              <h5> Statistics Screen : </h5>
              <br>
              Purely for aesthetic and informational purposes, this screen is
              mainly here to show minor statistics about where the user's money is going.
              <br> <br>
              Similar to the transaction screen, if they want to view the
              statistics of a specific account, you can easily navigate between
              accounts using the selector.
              <br> <br>
              Four major statistics I found interesting were "How much money
              did I spend since I downloaded this app?", "Where do I go the
              most?", "What was my biggest paycheck?", and "What was my
              largest purchase?". So because those were all I could think of,
              I decided to implement them all.
              <br> <br>
              For a more casual list of statistics, I have also implemented the
              ability to view the total amount of money spent at every single
              manually entered location.
