              <br>
              Upon entering the application, the 'Home Screen' is where the user will be able to see the upcoming announcements for the week.
              <br><br>
              This screen differs between those who are logged in and those who are logged out.
              However, the only differences are that those who are logged in have the option to log out and
              any announcements for the staff will only show up in the list if there is a user logged in.
              <br><br>
              Each and every announcement is clickable and once clicked, will provide any further details entered by the staff.

              <h5> Response Card Screen : </h5>
              <br>
              As of right now, this is the only feature available for the students. However since the application is not released, this is just here temporarily.
              <br> <br>
              Currently, every Sunday consists of effort being put into cutting dozens of sheets of paper into 'Response Cards'.
              In order to prevent wasted paper as well as an optimal amount of response cards, perhaps by providing them electronically,
              students will be able to write down any prayer requests during any day of the week.
              <br> <br>
              There are multiple options for the student to press and because some options will be redundant if others are pressed, these corresponding options will disappear to avoid confusion.
              <br> <br>
              After selecting all the corresponding options, the student can enter all necessary information and once sent, will appear for the selected staff.

              <h5> Login / Registration Screen : </h5>
              <br>
              This screen has three options set for the staff to choose from. The staff is separated into two general positions: Mentors (teachers) and Pastoral Staff (administrators).
              <br> <br>
              Upon selecting a position to register an account for, they will be prompted with a 8-digit registration code that differs between the two positions.
              Once they enter, each position requires some different information to be saved.
              <br> <br>
              Once the account is created, the user will be able to log in using the third button in the list.

              <h5> Logs Screen : </h5>
              <br>
              Every week the Mentors (teachers) are in charging of leading a quick 30-minute class and after it is completed, provide details about how the class went.
              Prior to the application's release, the log format was either in Google Forms or with paper and pen.
              The largest issue is that the Mentors would forget to hand in their logs, so the hope for this application is to make logs more manageable.
              <br> <br>
              All information is entered into the screen and once the 'Submit' button is pressed, will prompt an email to be sent to the church's youth group email.

              <h5> Directory Screen : </h5>
              <br>
              With a large youth group population of roughly ~200 students, keeping up-to-date information may be a little difficult.
              Using multiple accounts for each individual staff member, student information will be easily editable and viewable by staff members.
              <br><br>
              Mentors (teachers) registered to a certain grade will only be able to view/add/edit/delete the information of their grade's students,
              while any Pastoral Staff (administrative) members will be able to view the information of all students.
              <br><br>
              The following information is logged for each student: name, address, city, state, birthday, phone number, and grade.

              <h5> Prayer Request Screen : </h5>
              <br>
              This screen directly corresponds to the 'Response Card Screen'.
              <br><br>
              All corresponding prayer requests sent by the students will show up in this screen.
              For example, if a student wants his/her Mentors (teachers) to view the information, but not any of the Pastoral Staff (administrators), then only the corresponding Mentors will be able to see the prayer request.
              In contrast, if a student wants the Pastoral Staff to only see the prayer request, only the Pastoral Staff will be able to see it.
              <br><br>
              Similarly to the list of announcements, any prayer request can be clicked to view any details on a larger popup menu.

              Since this application was built to make Sundays easily for the staff and students, I personally believed that it would be in best interest to incorporate ideas from other members of the church.
              <br><br>
              If a certain feature is wanted by a majority of people, it would only make sense to implement it.
